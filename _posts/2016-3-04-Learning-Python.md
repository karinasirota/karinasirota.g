title: Learned how to make a chrome extension
---
Today I went to BadHacks here at Northwestern. It was sponsored by our IEEE chapter. It's only 8 hours and meant to be a pointless hack, so me and my team decided to make an obnoxious chrome extension. 

This was super simple. Chrome extensions literally takes a copy-and-paste manifest file and any sort of Javascript scripts to do things. Our code pops up with an alert and then forces the user to go on another page. It's like, 30 lines of code in total. I was quite happy with how easy it turned out to code this. I will most definitely work a few chrome extensions in the future.

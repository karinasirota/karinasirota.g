title: Chicago updates core curriculum
---
 Last week, Chicago became the first city in the country to make computer science education a core subject. This means that all students in Chicago public high schools will be required to take a computer science class in order to graduate. It'll be joining English and Math as core subjects. 

 This is a topic very near and dear to my heart. When I went to high school, I had no intention of taking any 'extra' science classes, other than what was required of me, which was biology and chemistry. I also ended up taking physics, since it was pretty much required for all the colleges I applied to. I took no AP science classes. Instead, I took newspaper classes and English classes galore. I thought I would be a journalism major or an English major or a marketing major throughout my time in high school. 

 Come college application time, I realized my number 1 college choice didn't offer a business school, which threw me for a loop. What was I going to study? After looking through all the majors extensively, I settled on Communications. It's a fine major, but I didn't think it was enough and I certainly didn't think that it was worth a quarter of a million dollars. So I started looking for another major. Econ didn't work for me, but I found I liked the introductory computer science class that I took for my math/science distro, so I decided to take the next class in the sequence. And then the next one. And then the next 23. 

 So how is this relevant to the argument?

 I wish that I had been required to take a CS in high school. A lot of my peers did, since it was required for all freshman taking Geometry and in the Talented Young Mathematicians Program. My parents pushed for me to take a class in high school, but it seemed pointless since I had already decided I wouldn't be a scientist. Little did I know that computer science wouldn't be the end for me; it would push me along to get to my goal. I had taken so many subjects in high school and was allowed to make some decisions there, but I never tried computer science. 

 To me, this is a step in the right direction. Computer literacy is important in the 21st century and programming is an important part of that. There's still a lot of work to be done in the rest of the country, though the President's computer science for all initiative is certainly in the right direction!

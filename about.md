### About Me



<img src="/images/Karina.Updated.HEAdshot.final.jpg" alt="karina" style="width:304px;height:470px;">

I'm a senior at Northwestern University studying Communications and Computer Science with a certificate in Integrated Marketing Communications. 
	Basically, I'm computationally-minded marketer, analyst and app maker. I am currently looking for full-time opportunities where business and technology collide. 

	I'm the Vice President of Recruitment for Northwestern's Junior Achievement club because I believe that all children deserve the tools they need to be successful.
	I'm the Community Outreach chair for Women in Computing because I believe in the power of computer science and how it can help anyone, any time, anywhere. 
  
  In my spare time, I'm a big fan watching Gilmore Girls, eating salmon and reading everything I can.
